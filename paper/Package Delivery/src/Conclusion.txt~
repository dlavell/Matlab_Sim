	The conclusion will most likely wrap up every major idea that was

In this article, we have introduced a domain-specific modeling language for 
programming autonomous vehicles. This is a much more effective than current 
methods for programming AVs because the DSL is much more expressive than a 
general-purpose language. Additionally, larger projects are easy to 
manage because the DSML allows for metaprogramming.

The constraint language included is also a crucial part of the DSML because 
it allows the programmer to guarantee the safety of a trajectory using the 
predefined set of constraints. It also allows for the creation of 
user-defined constraints that can guarantee custom controller 
safety, guarantee safe operation of a different AV, and offer adaptability 
to the needs of the testing environment.
