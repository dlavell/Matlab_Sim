Upon a package request, the location of who placed the order is added to a queue. The queue is read whenever there is an available vehicle at the warehouse. Trajectories are then built from the warehouse to the destination avoiding obstacles. Once assigned a trajectory, the vehicle follows the reference points along the trajectory until returning to the warehouse to recharge.
