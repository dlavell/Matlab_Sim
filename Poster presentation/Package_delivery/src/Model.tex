Upon a package request, the location of who placed the order is added to a queue. The queue is read whenever there is an available vehicle at the warehouse. Trajectories are then built from the warehouse to the destination, from the first destination to the second, and back to the warehouse. Once assigned a trajectory, the vehicle follows the reference points along the trajectory until returning to the warehouse to recharge. When in transit to the destination, the trajectory will keep the vehicle awway from the no-fly-zones defined around airports and above schools.
