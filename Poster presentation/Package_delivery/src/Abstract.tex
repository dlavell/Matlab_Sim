\textbf{\textit{For a few years now, delivery companies have been developing a variety of package-delivery systems using drones. Such technologies will most likely be integrated and implemented into fully functioning autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in the near future. However, the lack of studies on the effect of such a delivery system on the current National Airspace (NAS) traffic is unstudied.  Moreover, storage and performance requirements to implement a fully autonomous delivery system have not yet been quantified. In this project we implemented a test bench to that uses terrain, building, and population data to build an environment in which a package delivery scenario may be run using quadcopters. We showed that how number of vehicle per warehouse, how soon the warehouse guarantee the package to be delivered, and on board storage required to run the system.} }
