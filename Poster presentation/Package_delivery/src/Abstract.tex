\textbf{\textit{For a few years now, delivery companies have been developing a variety of package-delivery systems using drones. Such technologies will most likely be integrated and implemented into fully functioning autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the near future. However, the lack of studies on the effect of such a delivery system on the current National Airspace (NAS) traffic is unstudied.  Moreover, storage and performance requirements to implement a fully autonomous delivery system have not yet been quantified. In this project we implemented a test bench using terrain, building, and population data to construct an environment for a package delivery scenario. We showed that extending the payload capabilities of the UAV improved the number of packages delivered.} }
