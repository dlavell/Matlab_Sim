Due to the highly unstudied nature of this subject, there are many possible future directions that this project can take, some of which include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Creating a hardware-in-the-loop testbed, as exemplified in Figure 4.}

\item{Developing a navigation framework necessary to traverse dense urban environments.}

\end{enumerate}
