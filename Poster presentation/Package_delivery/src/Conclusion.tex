Due to the highly unstudied nature of this subject, there are many possible future directions that this project can take, some of which include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Creating a hardware-in-the-loop testbed, exemplified in figure X, to study the effects of a distributive delivery system}

\item{Designing a system to allow multiple warehouses to collaboratively and dynamically delivery packages}

\item{Developing a navigation framework necessary to traverse dense urban environments}

\end{enumerate}
