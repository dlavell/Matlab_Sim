Completing the project, we have built a framework to test complex coordinated UAV manuevers. We have applied this to create a realistic scenario to assess the feasibility in using vehicles that can carry more than one package at a time when being used in an autonomous package delivery service. By maximizing the number of packages each vehicle carries and minimizing the additional transit time to get the othe second destination we have shown that a multiple package delivery system can out perform a single package per vehicle delivery system. Future work for this project will be to fully integrate hardware in the loop simulations using the Crazyflie quadcopter and 3D motion capture feedback camera system.
