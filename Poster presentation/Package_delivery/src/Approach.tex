The following Systematic approach was used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Defining the problem
\item Defining constraints and variable
\item modeling
\item implementation
\end{itemize}

May be if we want to itemize it in a diffrent way

\begin{enumerate}
\item Defining the problem
\item Defining constraints and variable
\item modeling
\item implementation
\end{enumerate}
