\begin{itemize}
\item{Data Collection - In order to simulate a more realistic simulation environment we collected terrain, population, Walmart, and K-12 schools from San Jose. The data was provided from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), United States Census Bureau, Walmart.com, and Schooldigger.com, respectively.}
\item{Initial Framework - The structure of the simulation focused around which warehouses were chosen to have a delivery fleet.}
\item{Single Package Delivery - UAS vehicles reponded to one one request traversing to the destination and following the same path back to the warehouse.}
\item{Multiple Package Delivery - UAS vehicles carrying multiple packages optimize which destinations to delivery to based on proximity to the first destination.}
\end{itemize}
