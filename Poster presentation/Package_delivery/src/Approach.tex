\item{Data Collection - In order to simulate a more realistic environment we collected data for terrain, population, Walmart, and K-12 schools from San Jose. The data was provided from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), United States Census Bureau, Walmart.com, and Schooldigger.com, respectively.}\\

\item{Initial Framework - The structure of the simulation focused around which warehouses were chosen to have a delivery fleet. Elevation and obstacles around these warehouses were compiled before the simulation ran.}

\vspace{7mm}

\item{Single Package Delivery - UAV responded to package requests one at a time and then traversed the same path to and from the warehouse.}

\vspace{7mm}

\item{Multiple Package Delivery - After being assigned the first package to deliver, vehicles waited on the ground until a nearby second package was requested or until the time to wait on the ground expired.}

\vspace{7mm}

\item{Analysis - To assess the feasibility of a multiple package per vehicle delivery system, we ran the simulation using both the single and multiple package per vehicle approach to evaluate their performance.}
