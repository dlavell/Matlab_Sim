With growing interest to improve efficiency of package delivery, some companies, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Google, are strongly considering the use of UAV as carriers for the packages. In terms of the NAS, the traffic this would induce has been mostly unstudied. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wants to regulate the air traffic in the NAS in the interest of the people. The companies trying to implement this delivery service want to maximize throughput while meeting time constraints. We propose a solution that meets the requirements of both the FAA and prospective companies using a multiple package per vehicle delivery scheme.
